Both are wearing backpacks carrying their supplies. Thog is facing to the right as he walks down the road, carrying an unconscious Horbin in his arms, with a small pack hanging off his left arm. Xavros is slightly ahead of Thog, turning to look down at the sleeping Horbin.

&quot;Awww,&quot; exclaims Xavros. &quot;Horbin looks so peaceful when he's sleeping.&quot;" >

Behind them in the distance, the lighthouse ca be seen standing at the top of a hill.  A tree is to their left, with an old wooden sign on the right.  From the forward view, more of what Thog is carrying can be seen, including a variety of javelins that seemed to be strapped to the back of his bag.  Two small axes are hanging  out ot either side of his bag, with a much larger greataxe extending to the right behind Xavros's head.

Thog is looking down at Horbin in his hands, who is passed out, his mouth open wide as if mid snore. 

&quot;Thog prefers to hold a weapon while traveling,&quot; Thog says.

Xavros looks away from the two, rolling his eyes.  &quot;I told you, Thog,&quot; says Xavros, &quot;You can't drag him behind us using your fifty feet of rope.&quot" >

&quot;Thog will not be able to protect Xavros if there is an encounter,&quot; says Thog.

Xavros turns back to face his fellow party member. &quot;I can cast firebolt you know,&quot; says Xavros." >
