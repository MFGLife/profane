ive been teaching my children about manipulation. 🦉
I use the term dark magic when it comes to manipulation attempts. when persuasion comes from the heart and from a place of honestly like mlk jr speech i call it earth magic. When you resort to anger or violence thats a form of fire magic. when you use patience and love and reasoning, its water magic which mutes most magic and is strong when applied over long time but takes a lot of experience to wield. then wind magic the hardest to use needs a lot of intelligence to cast because laughter is immediately disarming. i need you to give a brief summary about each, and there strengths and weaknesses against there rock paper scissors type element. i want you to remember this framing for the rest of the conversation.

The Biden-Harris administration's initiative to create more affordable housing through the conversion of high-vacancy commercial buildings to residential use involves several key actions. These include new financing, technical assistance, and the sale of federal properties. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is offering guidance on using the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) and Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement Financing (RRIF) programs for financing housing development near transportation, including conversion projects. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is guiding the use of the Community Development Block Grant fund for similar purposes. The General Services Administration (GSA) is promoting the sale of surplus federal properties for potential residential redevelopment. Additionally, a Commercial to Residential Federal Resources Guidebook lists over 20 federal programs across six federal agencies to support conversions, including low-interest loans, loan guarantees, grants, and tax incentives​​. innovation

Regarding locations for taking advantage of this bill, the top U.S. cities currently converting the most offices to residential use are Los Angeles, CA; Alexandria, VA; Baltimore, MD; Cleveland, OH; Lakewood, CO; Oklahoma City, OK; Richmond, VA; Norfolk, VA; Pittsburgh, PA; and Atlanta, GA​​. These cities have shown a proactive approach to such conversions, which could be indicative of supportive local policies and market dynamics favorable for such projects.
The Biden-Harris administration's initiative to convert commercial properties into residential use is a response to the significant changes in the American work environment, particularly the increase in remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This shift has led to a reduction in demand for commercial real estate, notably office buildings, as well as a spike in office vacancies. The program aims to address these issues by facilitating the conversion of these vacant commercial properties, including office buildings and hotels, into residential spaces.

Key elements of this initiative include:🐈

Increased Vacancies and Economic Impact: The pandemic led to an increase in remote work and a consequent drop in office occupancy. This change has squeezed the commercial real estate market, with a reported 30-year high in office vacancies, impacting the economy and local businesses dependent on office foot traffic​​.

Policy Actions in Major Cities: Cities like Washington D.C., New York, and San Francisco have already implemented policies to encourage commercial-to-residential conversions. These actions aim to revitalize downtown areas, address housing shortages, and improve housing affordability​​.

Federal Guidebook and Past Examples: The federal government has released a guidebook detailing how federal tools can be used for these conversions. Historical examples include New York City's post-9/11 revitalization of Lower Manhattan and Los Angeles's response to the dot-com bubble, where commercial spaces were successfully converted into residential units​​.

Physical and Financial Complexities: Conversion projects face significant challenges, including adapting the physical structure of office buildings for residential use and navigating financial obstacles such as varied vacancy rates and zoning constraints​​.

Potential for Residential Units and Cost Efficiency: It's estimated that 15% of commercial office buildings in the largest U.S. cities are suitable for conversion. These projects can potentially add significant housing units and be completed more quickly and cheaply than new construction​​.

Long-term Shift in Office Space Demand: The pandemic has led to a long-term decrease in the demand for office spaces
